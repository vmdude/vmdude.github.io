In this dashboard, **each cluster is a color box displaying the most constrained resource among CPU, RAM and storage**. For example, when a cluster is using 33% of CPU, 58% of RAM and 40% of the shared storage, 58% will be displayed. If another cluster uses 21% of CPU, 45% of RAM and 76% of the shared storage, 76% will be displayed. The box is green between 1% and 65%, yellow between 65% and 80%, red above 80% and white under 1% so **you canâ€™t miss anything in your infrastructure**.
