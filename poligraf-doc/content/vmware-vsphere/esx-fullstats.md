title: ESX FullStats
---


The **ESX FullStats** dashboard is similar to the **Cluster FullStats** but for standalone ESX servers. Because we focus on ESX resources here, we did not aggregated the datastore and vmnic metrics. You’ll find a graph for every single one of them but you can select which one will be displayed if not all.

Like in **Cluster Fullstats**, you’ll be able to track memory overcommit ([i.e. TPS](http://www.hypervisor.fr/?p=5456)) in the memory quickstats graph but also CPU power management impact in the **CPU utilization/demand** graph if demand>usage.
