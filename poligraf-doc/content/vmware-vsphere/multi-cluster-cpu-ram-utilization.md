title: Multi Cluster CPU/RAM Utilization
---


The **CPU/RAM Utilization** dashboard allows to compare the compute metrics between clusters. Why? Because in 1s you’ll be able to catch if you forgot a **host in maintenance** mode in a cluster because the effective metric is much low that the total metric. You’ll also be able to see the **impact of the power management policy** you set on your servers with the demand and usage metrics. You may also noticed how low the guest usage (active) is compared to private metric (consumed). Or simply check how well balanced your clusters are.
