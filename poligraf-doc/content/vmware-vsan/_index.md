The metrics used in the various vSAN dashboards are collected **every minutes** using to the [QueryVsanStatistics API method of HostVsanInternalSystem](http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-60/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.wssdk.apiref.doc%2Fvim.host.VsanInternalSystem.html). With some json ticks, it is possible to access any metrics from the vSAN cluster. And guess what! We’re already working on other cool SexiPanels for VSAN…
