title: Diskgroup Capacity
---


In PoliGraf 0.99b we added an enhanced version of the initial vSAN Capacity dashboard. The **vSAN DiskGroup Capacity** let you monitor the space usage of each diskgroup of each cluster node. Now you see what is going on when you manually initiate [Proactive Rebalance](http://cormachogan.com/2015/10/08/vsan-proactive-rebalance-not-starting/).
