The VI Offline Inventory is automatically updated every 6 hours. If you want to force a refresh, you can use this section to perform a manual update. Just navigate from the **PoliGraf Web Admin** dashboard to this section and follow the walk-through explanation (basically, you just have to press a one or two buttons, we told you we wanted to make it easy-as-pie!).
