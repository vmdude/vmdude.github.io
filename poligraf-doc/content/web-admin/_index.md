What we wanted to achieve was to make an appliance as easy to use as possible. Therefore we developed some tools to make your life easier using **PoliGraf**. First, the Home page let you **monitor the health of your appliance** thanks to [collectd](https://collectd.org/):

Every tools are available through the web interface thanks to predefined dashboards like **PoliGraf Web Admin** or **PoliGraf VI Offline Inventory**. Just navigate to your PoliGraf web-ui with your favorite browser and select one of these dashboards as seen below:

You will have access then to the tool grid which let you select what you want to access to. As we will add more features to PoliGraf, we may also add other web tools in this section, so it may evolve in the future:
