As we plan to add lot of features and content to the **PoliGraf** appliance, we wanted to make update flawless for you. We didn’t want to say to you “Please update by redeploying a new appliance”. So we built a native updater that’s available in this section. When we will be releasing a new version of **PoliGraf**, we will provide you a \*.sup package (for **PoliGraf Update Package**) that you will upload to your appliance thanks to this page. After the upload is successfull (it shouldn’t be long as the package will be usually just a few hundred Kb), you will be able to start the upgrade process. After a few confirmation (we’re never too safe), the upgrade process will start, letting you enjoy the up-to-date version of **PoliGraf**, without any dataloss obviously.
