This dashboard is aimed at keeping track of SQL response time from a vCenter point of view. A healthy database backend is a must for vCenter Server, as a lot of thing is done in db.

> SQL execution times are extended and take a long time to complete.

If you have performance issue with your db server, there will be a lot of nasty outcome in your vCenter, such as failure of stats collection, gaps in performance charts, tasks queuing up, â€¦

If there is some issue on vcd side, you will see on `vpxd.log` files some statement about it:
    
    
    2015-03-06T10:50:06.207+01:00 [05384 warning 'Default' opID=SWI-7c33d20] [VdbStatement] Execution elapsed time: 6189 ms

The **SQLTooLong** dashboard will display database latency based on the `vdb_latency` field for every configured vCenter you have.

The golden rule for this dashboard is **the lower, the better!** If you have some unexpected high values (depending on your environment) â‡’ go check on your [DBA team][3] ðŸ™‚

This dashboard is actually a template and needs a bit of configuration. You need to replace the vCenter names by yours. Don't hesitate to add some query fields to split them up if you have a lot of vCenter.
