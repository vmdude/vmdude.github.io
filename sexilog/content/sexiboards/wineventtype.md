The **WinEventType** dashboard gives you a quick look over the [Windows EventLog types][1] repartition over time.

![][2]

By toggling the event type queries you can focus and leverage the Micro Analysis feature of Kibana on the Message field to quickly find the root cause of warnings and errors.

This dashboard is embedded in SexiLog. If you want up-to-date version for your own platform, the Gist code for this dashboard is:  `https://gist.github.com/sexibytes/ea9278382709c2d944c6`
